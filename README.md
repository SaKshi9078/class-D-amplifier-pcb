# Class D Amplifier PCB Design

This repository contains the complete design of a Class D Audio Amplifier
designed using KiCad.

## Project Overview
The project demonstrates the design flow of a Class D amplifier including
schematic design, PCB layout, and Gerber generation.

## Tools Used
- KiCad (Schematic & PCB Design)
- LTspice (Circuit Simulation)

## Files Included
- Schematic file (.kicad_sch)
- PCB layout file (.kicad_pcb)
- Gerber files for PCB manufacturing

## Description
The Class D amplifier uses an op-amp based comparator and MOSFET switching
stage. An LC filter is used at the output to recover the amplified audio signal.
